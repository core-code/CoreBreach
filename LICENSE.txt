To have a complete open-source re-distributable version of the game you have to replace everthing in story/ sounds/ models/ and the font N-Gage.
You can also build a binary that either works with the demo dataset from the website (which is "freeware") (by defining DEMO and undefining NODATA) or with the full dataset from game stores (which is commercial) (by undefining NODATA). 


You can find the complete text of the GPL v2 under which the main CoreBreach source code is licensed in GPL.txt
